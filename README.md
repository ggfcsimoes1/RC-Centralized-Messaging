# RC-Centralized-Messaging

The goal of this project is to develop a prototype of a centralized messaging service.
The development of the project requires implementing a Directory Server (DS) and a
User Application (User). The DS server and the various User application instances are
intended to operate on different machines connected to the Internet.
The DS will be running on a machine with known IP address and ports.
